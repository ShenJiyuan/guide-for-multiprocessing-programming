You can observe that three tools are mentioned here: openmp, hadoop and pthread.   
# what problems respectively
openmp and hadoop —— matrix multipication.   

pthread —— there are four threads (thread 1 output 1, thread 2 output 2, thread 3 output 3, ...). Now we have four    
           empty files A,B,C,D, and their contents should be like:       
           A : 1 2 3 4 1 2   
           B : 2 3 4 1 2 3   
           C : 3 4 1 2 3 4   
           D : 4 1 2 3 4 1
